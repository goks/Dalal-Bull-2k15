<dt style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What
is a Share/Stock?</dt>
<dd>A holder of stock (a shareholder) has a claim to a part of
the corporation's assets and earnings. A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shareholder</span>
is an owner of a company. </dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> For example, if a company
has 1,000 shares of stock outstanding and one person owns 100 shares,
that person would own and have claim to 10% of the company's assets.</div>
<br><dl><dt><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Whats the difference between Share and Stock?</span></dt><dd>"Stock" is a general term used to describe the ownership certificates of
 any company, in general, and "shares" refers to a the ownership 
certificates of a particular company.</dd></dl><dl><dt style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Who is a Stockbroker?</dt><dd>A stockbroker is an individual who is especially trained and certified to participate
in the securities market on behalf of clients. The stockbroker has a dual role, that of
principal and agent.&nbsp;</dd></dl><ul><li>When the Stockbroker acts as agent for the buyers and sellers of
securities, a commission is charged for this service.</li></ul><ul><li>When acting&nbsp; as principal, the stockbroker owns the securities and trade from this stock.
Usually a spread is made when the broker acts as principal because the securities are
bought at a price which is different from that at which he sells.</li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Types of transactions:-</span><br><dl><dt>1.Short sell</dt></dl><dl><dd>When
an investor goes LONG on an investment, it means he/she has bought a
stock believing its price will rise in the future. Conversely, when an
investor goes SHORT, he is anticipating a decrease in share price.
Short selling is selling of a stock that the seller doesn't own. More
specifically, a short sale is the sale of a security that isn't owned
by the seller, but that is promised to be delivered. That may sound
confusing, but it's actually a simple concept.<br><ul><li>Still with
us? Then lets see more: when you Short Sell a stock, your broker will
lend it to you. The stock will come from the broker's own inventory,
from another one of the Firm's customers, or from another brokerage
Firm. The shares are sold and the proceeds are credited to your
account. Sooner or later you must "close" the short by buying back the
same number of shares (called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Covering</span>)
and return them to your broker. If the price drops, you can buy back
the stock at the lower price and make a profit on the difference. If
the price of the stock rises, you have to buy it back at the higher
price, and you lose money.</li></ul></dd></dl>2.Short Cover<br><dl><dd>This
is the process by which you buy back the shares that you already Short
sold. First you sell and then you buy (just the opposite of the actual
transactions of buying and selling). But the catch is, when the market
closes at 15:30, all the shares that you have Short Sold &amp; not
Short Covered, will automatically be Short Covered (i.e. bought back).</dd></dl><dl><dt><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Limit Trading and Market Trading</span></dt><dd><ul><li>Limit
Trading - When you start playing the game you will see a field that
says Pending Order, well this is what limit trading is all about. Here
you may mention a price at which you want the shares to be bought or
sold if you are not happy with the current price. In DALAL BULL, all
the pending transactions that has not yet executed will be cancelled
automatically when the market closes (i.e. at 15:30). So set the limit
which may reach the target before 15.30. You will have to pay brokerage
only for the executed transactions.</li></ul><br><ul><li>Market Trading - You trade straight away without keeping any limit at the current price. And accordingly brokerage will be deducted for each successful transaction.</li></ul></dd></dl><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Terms used in DalalBull</span><br><ul><li>Stock
